1. Blocks that you showcase your individual skill
  I created blocks to allow the thickness of the line to change, the colors to change, to shake to erase, and more.
1. The images you created
I've created several images. I've taked photos of myself and accessorized them, I've taken photos of the table and played Hangman with the app, and Aarya drew nice backgrounds, with abstract art such as flowing rainbows and a ladder.
